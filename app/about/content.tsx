                <p>
                    I began my professional journey with roles focused on system security and cloud solutions, working extensively with technologies like AWS, Docker, and Ansible. At Lockheed Martin, I spearheaded efforts in cybersecurity, enhancing system protections and reducing vulnerabilities, which sharpened my skills in risk management and technical mitigation.

                <p>
                    Currently, I am an AI/ML Engineer at Lockheed Martin, where I develop machine learning models tailored for advanced sensing applications in the defense sector. My work involves extensive research and application of XGBoost models, creating efficient pipelines, and implementing these solutions to enhance the capabilities of edge devices and vehicles.

                <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I am eager to explore deeper into generative AI and participatory design in AI systems, aiming to create solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also ethically sound and user-centric. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to lead projects that bridge the gap between theoretical AI research and practical, impactful applications.
